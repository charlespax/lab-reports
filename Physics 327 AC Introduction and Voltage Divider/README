Questions:
How do I make an equation?

Q: How do I make an equation?
A: To create an inline text equation you simply surround the code you wish to use in your equation with dollar sign ($).

Example:
--------
The equation $F =  m a$ can be rewritten as $m = \frac{F}{a}$.\
--------

To create a numbered equation in your document you must use the "equation" environment.

Example:
--------
One of the most important equations in introductory physics is certainly
\begin{equation}
F = m a
\end{euqation}
--------

To reference a numbered equation use the "label" tag.

Example:
--------
Kinetic energy, given by equation \ref{eq:K}, is often called "the energy of motion."
\begin{equation}\label{eq:K}
K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
\end{equation}
