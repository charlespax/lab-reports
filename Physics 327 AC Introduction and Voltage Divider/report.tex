\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}
The AC voltage divider shown in figure \ref{fig:AC Voltage Divider} structurally similar to a DC voltage divider, where $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are resistors, with the important difference begin that $Z_2$ is a capacitor. The $V_{out}$ in figure \ref{fig:AC Voltage Divider} is described by equation \ref{eq:AC Voltage Divider}

\caption{AC voltage divider. $Z_1$ is a resistor and $Z_2$ is a capacitor.}\label{fig:AC Voltage Divider}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:AC Voltage Divider}
V_{out} = V_{in} \frac{Z_2}{Z_1 + Z_2}
\end{equation}

\section{Data}\label{sec:Data}
The circuit was assembled with R = 20 k$\Omega$ and C = 1000 pF.Because the impedance $Z_1$ depends on frequency, the output voltage $V_{out}$ also depends on frequency; angular frequency $\omega$ begin related to frequency $f$ by $\omega = 2 \pi f$ \cite{DoPb}.

The sinusoidal input voltage was used while measuring the dependence of the magnitude and phase of $V_{out}$ relative to $V_{in}$. The results of these measurements are plotted with their theoretical values in figures \ref{fig:plot01} and \ref{fig:plot02} respectivly. Measurements were taken at various frequencies ranging from 100 Hz to 1 MHz.

The exponential decay time dependence, a function generator was used to create a square wave pulse. Using equation \ref{eq:N} the exponential decay constant $\lambda$ can be found.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:N}
N = N_0 e^{- \lambda t}
\end{equation}
For $t = 0$,
\begin{displaymath}
\lambda = \mathrm{ln}\left(\frac{N}{N_0} \frac{-1}{t}\right) = 45647.6
\end{displaymath}
The decay calculated from $C$ and $R$ is plotted along with the measured values in figure \ref{fig:plot03}.

\section{Discussion \& Analysis}\label{sec:Discussion}
The circuit in figure \ref{fig:AC Voltage Divider} can also be used as a differentiator. The function generator was used to generate a triangular waveform. The output and input voltages were plotted on the oscilloscope screen as a function of time. The square wave $V_{out}$ is suprisingly similar to the proper differentiated values of the triangular wave. $V_{out}$ is positive or negative when the triangular wave has a positive or negative slope respectivly. The amplitude of the square wave is also what one would expect given the amplitude of $V_{in}$.
