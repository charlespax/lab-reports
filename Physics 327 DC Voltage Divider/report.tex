\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}
The resistive voltage divider in figure \ref{fig:Resistive_VD} is a simple device consisting of a voltage source and two resistors. The output voltage $V_{out}$ is related to $V_{in}$ by equation \ref{eq:V_out}. If $R_1 >> R_2$, $V_{out}$ varries almost linearly with $R_2$, while if $R_1 << R_2$, $V_{out}$, $V_{out} \approx V_{in}$.

\caption{Resistive voltage divider.}\label{fig:Resistive_VD}
\end{figure}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:V_out}
V_{out} = V_{in} \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}
\end{equation}

This is verified by working out the appropriate mathmatical expression shown in equation \ref{eq:Transform}\footnote{Answer to question one.}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Transform}
V_{out} = V_{in} \left(\left(\frac{R_2}{R_1}\right) - \left(\frac{R_2}{R_1}\right)^2\right)
\end{equation}

\section{Data \& Analysis}\label{sec:DataAnalysis}
\subsection{Part A}
A power supply provided the input voltage $V_{in} \approx 12$ V. Measurements for $V_{in}$ and $V_{out}$ were taken while setting $R_1$ = 100 k$\Omega$ for each value of $R_2$ = 1 $\Omega$, 10 $\Omega$, 100 $\Omega$, 1 k$\Omega$, 10 k$\Omega$, 100 k$\Omega$, 1 M$\Omega$. $R_1$ was reset to 100 $\Omega$ and the measurements for $V_{in}$ and $V_{out}$ repeated. Discrete components were used with their multimeter-measured values compared to their color-coded values in table \ref{fig:Resistors}.
\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|r|r|}
\hline
Color Code ($\Omega$)	& Measured ($\Omega$) \\
\hline
1			& 1.1 \\
10			& 10.1 \\
100			& 99.7 \\
1000			& 985 \\
10000			& 9930 \\
100000			& 102600 \\
1000000			& 1069000 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Resistence in ohms given by the resistors' color codes and the measured resistences.}\label{fig:Resistors}
\end{table}

For the first set of measurements $V_{out} / R_2$ versus log($R_2$) is plotted in figure \ref{fig:plot01}. In the region where $R_2$ is small the graph is close to linear; $0 < R_2 < 10000\ \Omega$\footnote{Answer to question two.}.

For the second set of measurements $V_{out}$ versus log($R_2$) is plotted in figure \ref{fig:plot02}. By the graph it is observed that $V_{out} \approx V_{in}$ when $R_2 > 1000$ k$\Omega$\footnote{Answer to question three.}.

\end{figure}

\caption{$V_{out}$ versus the log of $R_2$. $V_{out} \approx V_{in}$ when $R_2 > 1000$ k$\Omega$.}\label{fig:plot02}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Loading}\label{sec:Loading}
The term {\em loading} is used when a circuit with some resistence is connected across $V_{out}$. This is demonstrated by indirectly measuring $V_{out}$ using a load on the circuit. With $V_{in} = 12$ V, $R_1 = R_2 = 1$ k$\Omega$, a 12 k$\Omega$ resistor $R_m$ is placed in parallel with $R_2$, the current $I_m$ through $R_m$ measured, and $V_{out}$ calculated. Figure \ref{fig:Resistive_VD_loaded} shows the circuit.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{Diagram2.eps}
\end{center}
%\input{Diagram2}
\caption{Resistve voltage divider with load $R_m$.}\label{fig:Resistive_VD_loaded}
\end{figure}

For $R_m = 10000\ \Omega$ and 1000 $\Omega$, $I_m = 0.00039$ A and 0.0056 A respectivly. Calculating $V_{out}$ gives
\begin{displaymath}
V_{out,\ 10000} = I_m R_m = 0.00039\ \mathrm{A}\ 10000\ \Omega = 3.9\ \mathrm{V}
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
V_{out,\ 1000} = I_m R_m = 0.0056\ \mathrm{A}\ 1000\ \Omega = 5.6\ \mathrm{V}
\end{displaymath}
If $R_m = 0\ \Omega$, $V_{out} = 6$ V. These results demonstrate how the load on a simple voltage divider varries $V_{out}$, thus this circuit is not a good voltage source; one that provides a constant voltage independent of the load.

\subsection{Part B}
Some circuit components have a resistence that is not directly dependent on the current through them, but, rather, the applied voltage; meaning that the current is not proportional to the voltage. A light-emitting diode (LED) is an example of such a {\em non-ohmic} device. Figure \ref{fig:LED_VD} displays a circuit consisting of a resistor $R_1$ in series with a LED.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{Diagram3.eps}
\end{center}
%\input{Diagram3}
\caption{$R_2$ has been replaced with a LED to demonstrate the non-ohmic nature of LEDs.}\label{fig:LED_VD}
\end{figure}

The current through the circuit and voltages across the two elements were measured for each value of $R_1$ = 100 $\Omega$, 1 k$\Omega$, 10 k$\Omega$, 100 k$\Omega$, 1 M$\Omega$ while $V_{in} =5$ V. Figure \ref{fig:plot03} shows the  voltage-current dependence across the LED. For $R_1$ = 100 $\Omega$ the LED emitted bright light, 100, visable, 1000, faint, 10000 and 100000 none at all\footnote{Answer to question four.}. If the LED were an ohmic device, obeying Ohm's Law, the current-voltage relationship would be esentially linear throughout the graph because if the resistence is constant,  voltage divided by current would always have to equal the resistence\footnote{Answer to queation five.}.

\caption{Voltage across the LED versus the current across the LED showing the non-ohmic nature of LEDs.}\label{fig:plot03}
\end{figure}

\section{Discussion \& Conclusion}
For Ohmic devices the voltage across the device is directly proportional to the current running throught the device. For non-ohmic devices the voltage across and the current through the device are dependent on eachother. As demonstrated, the simple resistive voltage divider is not a good voltage source due to its dependence on the load on the circuit.
