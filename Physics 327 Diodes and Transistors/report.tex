\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}
Diodes have the extremely useful property of allowing current to flow in only one direction across themselves. One simple use of this property is converting alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC).

\section{Data}\label{sec:Data}
\subsection{Part A: Diodes}
The half wave rectifier circuit shown in figure \ref{fig:Half_wave_rectifier} was assembled with $R = 1000\ \Omega$ and diode 1N4001. A wave form generator was used to input a 966 Hz sinusodial alternating current across $V_{in} = 1.2$ V. figure \ref{fig:Image1} shows the output waveform of $V_{out}$\footnote{Answer to question 1.}. The amplitude of this wave is approximatly 0.4 V\footnote{Answer to question 2.}. The amplitude of $V_{out}$ is related to the amplitude of $V_{in}$ by $V_{out} \approx V_{in}/3$\footnote{Answer to question 3.}.% This circuit filters out voltages above 0.4 V.
\begin{displaymath}
V_{out} = \frac{V_{in}}{3}
\end{displaymath}

\end{figure}

The full wave rectifier circuit shown in figure \ref{fig:Full_wave_rectifier} was assembled with $R = 20$ k$\Omega$ and using a TC016 symmetric transformer, which has equal impedances in both windings. This transformer also has a center tap which allows the rectifier to be made with only two diodes. Figure \ref{fig:Image3} shows $V_{out}$ compared with $V_{in}$, where  $V_{out}$ is truncated at voltages above -0.2 V\footnote{Answer to question 4.}.

A 5000 pF capacitor was then added in parallel with resistor $R$ and had no effect on the circuit\footnote{Answer to question 5.}. A much larger capacitor of 0.1 $\mu$F was inserted in place of the 5000 pF capacitor. Figure \ref{fig:Image4} and Figure \ref{fig:Image4} show the circuit output with no capacitor and with a 0.1 $\mu$F capacitor respectivly\footnote{Answer to question 6.}. To keep the voltage variation to less than 1\% at 996 Hz the capacitor would have to be approximatly 161 $\mu$F\footnote{Answer to question 7.}.

\subsection{Part B: Transistors}
Two simple circuits were constructed to investigate the nature and behavior of transistors. A two resistor voltaage divider with $R_1 = 912\ \Omega$ and $R_2 = 911\ \Omega$ and $V_{in} = 11.9$ V constructed. $V_{out}$ was measured to be $V_{out} = 5.99$ V\footnote{Answer to the first part of question 8.}. A load resistor of $R_{load} = 510\ \Omega$ was placed in parallel with $R_2$ and the output voltage was then measured to be $V_{out} = 3.05$ V. Figure \ref{fig:plot01} shows the relationship between the output voltage as a function of the output current across the load resistor. The output impedance of the voltage divider is given by sum of parallel resistors, Equation \ref{eq:resistor-parallel}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:resistor-parallel}
Z = \frac{R_2 R_{load}}{R_2 + R_{load}}
\end{equation}
Which yields\footnote{Answer to question 9.}
\begin{displaymath}
Z = \frac{911\ \Omega\ 510\ \Omega}{911\ \Omega\ + 510\ \Omega} = 326\ \Omega
\end{displaymath}

The cicuit shown in figure \ref{fig:diagram3} was constructed the above voltage divider, sans $R_{load}$, using a 2N3904 NPN transistor and $R_e =1000\ \Omega$. The output voltage was measured as $V_{out} = 5.31$ V and the voltage across $R_e$ as... \footnote{Answer this question 10.}.

A 510 $\Omega$ load resistor was added in parallel with $R_e$ and the output voltage measured as $V_{out} = 5.26$ V. The results are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:plot01} and compared to the voltage divider measurements\footnote{Answer to question 11.}.
